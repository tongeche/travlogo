# Travlog Mundo: Your Global Travel Companion

Welcome to Travlog Mundo, a modern web application designed to help users discover and book various travel services including hotels, car rentals, flights, and tours. This project demonstrates integration with external APIs (Amadeus, and  Booking.com RapidAPI) and uses Supabase for database management, built with modern web technologies like HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), and JavaScript.

## Features

* **Dynamic Content Loading**: Hotels, Car Rentals, Flights, and Tours are fetched from external APIs and displayed dynamically.
* **Search & Filter**: (Potentially add this once implemented)
* **Affiliate Links**: Redirects users to external booking platforms.
* **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS for a mobile-first approach.
* **Modular JavaScript**: Services for each travel type keep the code organized.
* **Data Ingestion Scripts**: Automated scripts to populate the Supabase database.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend**:
    * HTML5
    * CSS3 (with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/))
    * JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Backend / Data Layer**:
    * [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): PostgreSQL database, Authentication, and Edge Functions.
    * Node.js: For running data ingestion scripts.
* **APIs**:
    * [Amadeus Travel APIs](https://developers.amadeus.com/): For Flights, Hotels, Cars/Transfers, and Tours data.
    * (Previously attempted: Booking.com RapidAPI - Note: encountered endpoint issues)
* **Tooling**:
    * [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): For continuous deployment and hosting.
    * [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/): For CSS transformations (used by TailwindCSS).
    * Git
